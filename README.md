# AdventOfCode2022

To run a solution:
1. Go to the src directory
2. compile the file (javac AOCXX.java)
3. run the file, passing a filepath to your test data as an argument (java AOCXX *FILE_PATH*)

NOTE:
   Some solutions may contain bugs. Check the comments in the .java file for known bugs.
   

Merry Christmas!
